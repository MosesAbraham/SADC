                        <h1 class="title pb-3 mb-5">NAVIGATING SADC'S ROADMAP: BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE</h1>
                        <p>For Southern Africa Development Community, SADC, economic development does not necesssarily mean space explotation or sending people to Mars, we are not there yet. With most of its members renowned as third world countries, economic development simply means ensuring that every citizen meets the basic needs which are food, shelter, clothes, and others alike.  </p>
                        <div class="row mb-4">
                            <P>To achieve this in a small scale is relatively easy but for a semi-continental community, there must be a sound and vibrant plan to ensure the welfare of every citizen.  This is why SADC has marked industrialization as the best way to achieve this.</P>
                           <P>For those who are new to this concept, worry out, I will you walk you through how SADC has laid out a strategy and roadmap to ensure sustainable industrialization for inclusive and economic growth.</P>
                        <h3>WHAT IS INDUSTRIALIZATION?</h3>
                        <p>According to Dr. David A. Hounshell, Professor of Technology and Social Change at Carnegie Mellon University,"Industrialization is a process of social and economic change that transforms a human group from an agrarian society into an industrial one, involving the extensive re-organization of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing" </p>
                        <p>Simply put, industrialization is the process of using technology and machinery to increase the production of goods and services. It began in Europe during the 1800s in what was called industrial revolution with England as the main pioneer. Still, in the twenty first century SADC has the potential to become a ------________ in global industrialization.</p>
                        <p>But first, here is how SADC is planning to ensure proper implementation of industrialization through its activities and programmes:</p>
                       <h5>THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SADC INDUSTRIALIZATION WEEK. </h5>
                        <p>This is an annual event that brings together stakeholders from public and private sector to discuss and promote industrialization in the region. the week serves as a platform for sharing knowledge, experience as well as for networking and patnership building.</p>

                        <h5>THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SADC INDUSTRIALIZATION STRATEGY AND ROADMAP.  </h5>
                        <p>Adopted in 2015, the strategy seeks to encourage economic development and technological transformations in the SADC region. It focuses on the development of agro-processing, mineral beneficiation and manufacturing as priority areas for industrialization. In South Africa, the government has implemented the agro-processing support scheme to provide funding and support for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
                        <h5>DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL PARKS AND SPECIFIC ECONOMIC ZONES,SEZ PROGRAM.</h5>
                        <p>This program aims to create condusive environments for industrial development by providing infastructure, services and support to investors. The program has shown valuable contribution to the development of industrial parks in countries like Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique, which have attracted investments and created jobs in the textile and manufacturing sectors.</p>

                        <h5>THE ENACTION OF SADC PLATINUM DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE.</h5>
                        <p>This was established more specifically for platinum-rich countries in the SADC region which are South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Overall, the SADC region is very rich in mineral resources including gold, diamond, platinum and copper, which are in a global demand. Example D.R.C Congo has an estimated mineral worth of over $24 trillion. it is also the leading producer of cobalt, which is used for production of Lithium ion, Li-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. The Platinum Development Initiative and mineral beneficiation sector aims to add value to the mineral exports from the SADC region.</p>
                       <h5>SADC RENEWABLE ENERGY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN, RESAP.</h5> 
                        <p>Considering the environmental effects brought by western industrialization, it is safe to say that following the traditional industrilation path of depending on fossil fuel is no the way to go. The SADC region,through RESAP has decided to facilitate sustainable industrialization through the integration of renewable energy in the region. The objective of RESAP, initiated by the SADC secretariat with the government of Finland, is to explore options to increase the use of renewable energy in Southern Africa,and to ensure that the regional energy strategy is aligned with global trends towards clean and alternative energy sources.
                            As the energy ministers said in a statement released after their meeting, "We note that renewable energy is an integral part of the United Nations Sustainable Energy for all initiative and urge member states, assigned by the SADC Secretariat, to mobilize resources to finalize the SADC Renewable Energy Strategy and Action"</p>

				<h5>SADC REGIONAL INFASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT MASTER PLAN, RIDMP.</h5>
                          <p>MISSING</p>
                        <p>Generally, these six examples highlight the SADC region's commitment to promoting industrialization. These activities have contributed to the region's development by adding value to exports, creating jobs and increasing competitiveness. Moreover, by focusing on sustainable and inclusive industrialization practices, the SADC region is clearly working to create a more prosperous future for all its citizens.</p>
                        <p>For SADC's secretariat, it is clear that a proper implementation of its industrialization-based projects, the region as a whole should check and intervene -with a goal to improve for the better-- in various areas. Below are some focus areas SADC region should intervene for maximum execution of its projects:(add barrier intro)</p>
                        <h5>INFRASTRUCTURE</h5>
                        <p>The improvement of infrastructure is necessary to support the growth of industrialization. This includes investing in the construction and maintenance of transport networks, as well as ensuring that electricity is reliable and affordable for businesses. The expansion of ports alone will enable SADC's landlocked countries to reach a goal of 148 million tonnes of traffic by 2040, an 8.2% annual growth rate. Currently,  many roads and airports are in poor conditions, this increases the cost of production which in turn reduces the competitiveness in global market. (example of poor infrastructure)</p>
                      <h5>SKILLS DEVELOPMENT.</h5>
                        <p>SADC should focus on establishment of training programs and investment in education that will create industrial experts and boost innovation. This is necessary for businesses to gain the ability to compete in the global market and meet the demands of the 21st economy. By capitalizing on initiatives like SADC skills Development and Innovation project, the region can improve the employability and productivity of young people in the region. Without skills development, SADC will remain independent on professionals from other parts of the world mainly Europe and Asia. Many of the projects in SADC countries are neither built nor run by natives, which proves that lack of skilled workforce is a major barrier to industrialization. (example)</p>

                        <h5>ACCESS TO MARKETS.</h5>
                        <p>SADC's member states ought to work together to create a conducive environments for local businesses to access both domestic and international markets. This can be achieved by removing trade barriers, reducing bureaucracy and promoting regional value chains particularly in rural areas. SADC should also ensure the production of standard and high quality goods with international standards to attract foreign market, while keeping prices low for the domestic market. The lack of access of markets, being a barrier, is caused by bureaucracy, trade barriers and unfavourable prices, and limits the potential for trade and earning foreign currency earnings.</p>
                       <h5>THE FINANCIAL SECTOR.</h5>
                        <p>Another key area that SADC needs to intervene is the access to finance for businesses, particularly small and medium sized enterprises. SADC should make efforts to increase the access to finance through microfinance, credit guarantees and venture capital. The region should also make use of regional banks and the African Development Bank, to access loans and aids for their projects ( more )</p>
